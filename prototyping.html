    <h3>Briefing given to users:</h3>
    <p>"This is the Marvel Comics Timeline Explorer, where you can learn more about different Marvel Comics storylines and characters.  You can
      <br>choose to click on "Start Exploring" to receive a random comic's information, you can select "Filter" to filter to specific characters
      <br> or groups you may want to read about, and you can select "Help" if you have any questions about how the website operates.  You can view the
      <br> entire timeline by scrolling from left to right with the bar at the bottom of the page."</p>
    <h3>Scenario Tasks:</h3>
    <li>Scenario 1: Filter the timeline for "Avengers" stories.</li>
    <li>Scenario 2: Click on a story that is published after 2020.</li>
    <li>Scenario 3: Start exploring a random story, then filter any character or group you want, then remove the filter.</li>
    <h3>Observations:</h3>
    <p>The three users I had run through my scenarios thought that my UI was pretty intuitive and easy to use.  The one potential error in the process
    <br>I had noticed involved not necessarily knowing how to explore a random story by just starting on the home page, even after my briefing.</p>
    <h3>Prototype Iteration:</h3>
    <p>In comparison to my first iteration, not much changed after the users went through the scenarios.  The only addition will be the inclusion of a "Welcome"
    <br>pop-up, so to speak, that will appear when first landing on the website over the home page, that explains the basics of how to use the website (a simpler
    <br>explanation than the "help" pop-up window will provide).</p>
