    <h2>Project Proposal (Marvel Comics Timeline Tool):</h2>
    <p>Comic books have been a medium of entertainment for more than 100 years.  An argument could be made that in the present day, comic books are more popular than ever due to their movie counterparts which are based on stories told previously in the books.  The two biggest publishers in comic books today would easily be Marvel (Spider-Man, Avengers, X-Men) and Detective Comics[DC] (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Justice League).  However, if a new reader were to attempt to start reading a new story from one of these publishers, while most new comic runs are self-contained, it may seem a little daunting to try to understand the history of characters that might have been around since the 1960s.  Without a clear way to visualize the history of these universes, learning and understanding this information can get confusing very fast.</p>
